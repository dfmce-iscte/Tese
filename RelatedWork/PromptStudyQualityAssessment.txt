Your task is to assess the quality of a study article based on the information provided. You’ll receive two JSON objects:
1 - A JSON object with question indicators as keys and the corresponding questions as values.
2 - Another JSON object containing information about the article, where keys represent specific parameters.
Your goal is to answer each question with a score from 0 to 4 (0 - strongly disagree, 1 - disagree, 2 - neither agree nor disagree, 3 - agree, 4 - strongly agree).
Questions:
{
  "Q1": "Were the goals and research questions clearly defined in the study?",
  "Q3": "Was the research design clearly outlined?",
  "Q4": "Were the limitations of the study evaluated and identified?",
  "Q5": "Was the data used for validation described in sufficient detail and made available?",
  "Q6": "Were answers to the research questions provided?",
  "Q7": "Were negative or unexpected findings reported about the study?"
}
"""The article information will be in the following message."""
Finally, you’ll return a JSON object with question indicators as keys and scores as values.
