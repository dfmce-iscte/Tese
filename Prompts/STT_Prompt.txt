You are a research assistant working on a project to characterize Smart Tourism Tools (STTs). 
Smart Tourism Tools are seamlessly interconnected digital solutions/tools designed to benefit all stakeholders in the tourism sector, with a special focus on the tourist and the destination, which aim at sustainable development. The focus on the "tourist" and "destination" levels is one of the characterizers that will distinguish the similarity between STT tools, and the sustainable development objective is also another important characterizer to distinguish the intelligence of STT. The level of intelligence of the STT depends more on the achievement of these objectives than on its technological status. At their highest level, STT produce experiential bliss at the dynamic human interface with technology, enriching rather than alienating people. Emerging technologies offer unforeseen possibilities, of course, but so does innovation combine with conventional technology. In other words, a company cannot be a possible STT, but the products/tools they produce can be considered a possible STT. So confirm whether it is a company or not.
Your job is to read the text delimited by triple quotes and, based on that text, do the following tasks:

- Returns a json list of all the STTs you've found, if there are any. If don't exist, return an empty list. Don't return any text before the json list or after the json list. Just return the json list.
- And for each STT you've found, return it in a json format, with the following keys:
'stt_name': Identify the STT name.
'stt_description': Identify the STT description.
'parties_responsible': Identify the parties responsible for creating the STT.
'parties_description': List each party description, if there are any. If it doesn't exist, return an empty list, or if there is no description for a party, don't include it in the list.
'urls': List each URL, if there are any. If it doesn't exist, return an empty list.
'is_STT': Assigns a boolean value according to the following classification. True - the product/tool is an STT. False - the product/tool is not an STT.
If you set is_STT to false, leave the next attributes empty.
'STT_dom': Identify the STT operation domain(s). Be aware, that some STTs can operate in more than one of the domains. There are three STT operation domains (operation domain, description): ("Product", "the tourism product experienced by the end user (tourist)"), ("Marketing", "the marketing of the tourism product/business/destination") and ("Management_&_operations”, "the management and operations of the tourism product/business/destination").
'STT_type': Identify the STT tool type. Each STT operation domain has its own types of STT. If 'SST_dom' is "Product", then the possible STT types (STT type name, description) are: ("Fully digital_experience", "STTs that constitute tourism experiences taking place in the virtual world (e.g. virtual tours)"), ("Partial_digital_experience", "Core STTs that enable and/or enrich the tourism experience in the real world (e.g. guided tours in augmented reality)") and ("Building_block", "Tools that support the enrichment of the tourism experience (e.g. creation of audio or video content)"). If 'STT_dom' is "Marketing", then: ("Pre-consumption", "STT used at the stage when tourists participate in the decision-making process (e.g. by selecting and booking the destination and the corresponding tourist services)"), ("Consumption", "STT used at the consumption stage, when tourists enjoy the pre-selected tourism services") and ("Post-consumption", "STT used in the phase where tourists act as influencers of other users (e.g. by sharing feelings aroused and/or content created during the consumption phase)"). Finally, if 'STT_dom' is "Management_&_operations", then:
("Design_of_tourism_products", "STTs aimed at helping in the creation of the tourism offer (e.g. Business-to-Business (B2B) platforms that help create tour packages)"), ("Deployment_of tourism_products", "STTs helping with the deployment of the tourism offer (e.g. online booking and payment platforms)"), ("Operation_of_tourism_products", "Supporting the operation of the tourism offer (e.g. crowd management tools)") and ("Maintenance/evolution_of_tourism_products", "STTs that help in the assessment and decision-making of the existing tourism offer (e.g. data analysis tools)").
'tech_fields': List each technological field involved.
'SD_declared': List each declared contribution to a sustainable development, if there are any stated in the document. If there aren’t, return an empty list.
'SD_inferred': List each inferred contribution to a sustainable development, if it is not possible to infer return an empty list.
Don't forget to return a json list and respect the json keys for each STT.
