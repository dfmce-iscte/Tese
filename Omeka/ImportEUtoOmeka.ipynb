Aarhus has a strong LGBTQ+ community and every year, the Aarhus Pride parade celebrates diversity in Aarhus and contributes to the respect for and acceptance of all LGBTQ+ persons. Also, the Aarhus City Council has a strong focus on making Aarhus a better and more attractive city and a better and more attractive workplace for LGBTQ+ persons. As the first city in Denmark, Aarhus in 2019 joined the Rainbow Cities Network, including 33 cities in 17 different countries, actively working to improve conditions for LGBTQ+ citizens. Aarhus also hosts ‘KØN – Gender Museum Denmark’ presenting the cultural history between genders, equality, body and sexuality. A comprehensive policy of the City entitled ‘Aarhus for us all’ is addressing accessibility issues for people with special needs. The policy reflects the fact that the City has a holistic approach to creating an accessible environment for everyone, with a focus on people with disabilities. Aarhus wants everyone to feel valued and have equal opportunities when it comes to making use of the city. Based on the City’s three values, Reliability, Respect, and Commitment, Aarhus wants to ensure that people with all types of disabilities are given the option to live an independent life and opportunities to participate on their own terms.   Find out more at: https://www.aarhus.dk/english/collaborate-with-the-city/inclusive-citizenship/inclusion/     \n",

      "Description: The Acoustic Pedestrian Warning Device System applications were implemented at the intersections in different parts of the city in Antalya. It aims to make the pedestrian crossings at signalised intersections safer and available for independent use for the visually impaired and elderly people. With the Acoustic Pedestrian Warning Device, when the pedestrian signal transmitters change colour, audible messages are given to the pedestrians, allowing them to cross the street or wait. When the pedestrians come to the pedestrian crossing, when they show their hand from 5cm distance or touch, the system sends a request for a pedestrian crossing to the intersection device. When the time given for crossing the road is completed, the beep sound indicated for the red light will be activated and this warning will continue until the request button is pressed again. In addition, warnings in touristic areas are made in English.        Find out more at: https://raillynews.com/2020/12/Traffic-lights-will-speak-for-the-visually-impaired-in-Antalya/     \n",
