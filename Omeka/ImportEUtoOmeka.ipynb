For drivers to be able to see which parking space is free at any time, and therefore plan where they could park, a special application for mobile devices has been created and is available to everyone, both the citizens of Dubrovnik and tourists. This saves drivers time looking for a free parking space and reduces congestion caused in large part by drivers circling the streets in search of an available space to park. In some places in the city, a system of twenty public information displays has been set up to enable those citizens who do not use the application to see the free parking spaces a few streets earlier and to be able to see which place is available in time.

This project began in 2017 and provided some momentum for culture and creativity in the city, not only in terms of activities and cultural expression, but also in terms of creation and redevelopment of cultural spaces and hubs, plus promotion of gatherings to share experiences. The City of Media Arts has essentially operated out of two “houses” - gnration and the Theatro Circo - and has also helped to revitalise these spaces. The cultural centre gnration is a space for creation, performance, and exhibition in the field of contemporary music and the relationship between art and technology. By adopting a sustained strategy, always open to the community, it intends to confirm its status as a unifying pole for cultural and creative dynamics, making it a space oriented towards educating and raising awareness in a new audience, demonstrating artistic practices relevant from a contemporary and cosmopolitan perspective. The cultural schedule of gnration is founded on two fundamental pillars, which can be viewed independently or jointly. Contemporary music and the relationship between art and technology are central to the programme, whether the profile is performance, exhibition, or education. Also operating inside this space is Startup Braga, a corporate incubator which seeks to foster and encourage entrepreneurship in the city and has the municipality’s support. Today, the Theatro Circo is a really dynamic cultural broadcasting centre, time and again exceeding the target of 100,000 spectators to become a geographical hub.

For instance, Les Bassins de Lumières, the largest digital art centre in France, is housed in an old submarine base from the Second World War, plunging visitors into the works of Monet, Renoir, and Chagall. Similarly, Le Musée Mer Marine is another symbolic building to have emerged in the district, shining a light on the oceanic world and sailing, and the Cap Sciences popularises scientific culture for both adults and children.

The Old Vine virtual experience is an upgrade of the remarkable story of the 450-year-old vine.

During this VR experience, visitors can also get to know important Maribor historical events, personalities and legends and observe the changes that took place on Lent over the centuries. The Old Vine House is located in the heart of the old city centre. The age of the “Žametovka” or “Modra Kavčina” vine is over 400 years and has won it a place in the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest noble grapevine in the world still bearing grapes. The Old Vine is a symbol of the rich wine culture of Maribor, Styria, and all of Slovenia. The house was built in the 16th century, and the south side of the House has seen no major architectural changes since then. Today, the Old Vine House is a temple of wine tradition and culture of Maribor, Styria, and Slovenia, offering guided tours of rich wine legacy and other museum exhibits.
