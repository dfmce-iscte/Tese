      "Description: VisitAarhus, is certified as a ‘Green Tourism Organisation’ and around 70% of all hotels in Aarhus already hold an official, international eco-certification, such as Green Key and Nordic Eco- Label, to protect the environment within requirements that entail reducing energy and water use, CO2 emissions and waste generated. Thanks to this proactive approach to sustainability, Aarhus has capable of successfully host high-profile events such as the launch of the Michelin Guide Nordic Countries in 2019 in an environmental-friendly way. “The Green Conference and Event Handbook” offers checklists and guidance from Aarhus University and the VisitAarhus Convention Bureau on planning any event in the city and, thanks to these practices, the city gained spot in the ‘Top 100’ on the highly recognized ranking by the International Congress & Convention Association (ICCA).\n",

The ‘Aarhus Sustainability Model’ for sustainable development includes a guide and examples to bring sustainability into a European context across the cultural sectors. For example, NorthSide, Denmark’s most sustainable festival, takes place in Aarhus, and the organisers of the event have ensured green solutions for everything, from food and dealing with waste to power supply based on 100% green electricity. The festival’s sustainability programme ‘Lead the Way’ governs decisions about procurement, investment, collaborators, interior design, resource management, transport, charity and the supply of organic food and beverages throughout the festival. Likewise, Aarhus’ Moesgaard Museum is one of the world’s most energy-efficient museums, built with sustainability in mind from the start, including building materials and an optimal use of daylight, decreasing overall energy consumption and water waste. The green roof of the museum contributes to decreasing the energy consumption of the building and reduces the overall need for cooling due to decreased heat absorption.\n",

While the first Ocean Race in Europe has arrived in Genoa in June 2021, the Grand Final and the project ‘Racing with Purpose’ will take place in 2023. The sustainability programme brings together a range of tangible ways that will positively impact the marine environment such as rolling out initiatives for cleaner, healthier seas and a learning programme. Genoa as host city makes use of the Ocean Race by contributing vital scientific data to aid the understanding of ocean health and the effects of climate change by using our race boats to collect valuable data on sea surface temperature and ocean acidification. Moreover, the city will ensure that every element of the race village is sustainably produced: from being free of single-use plastic to the seafood served on site and invite people who visit the events to help protect the ocean. In overall, the city will use the Ocean Race Summits series as an occasion to change the way people behave towards the ocean for good. It will therefore host innovation workshops for sailing clubs and offer learning programmes for adults and schoolchildren about the issues affecting the ocean. When in June 2021 the Ocean Race arrived in Genoa, the whole race village was powered by 100% renewable energy and the Race was climate positive, supported by blue carbon projects. This will inspire others to act on climate change. Find out more at: https://www.visitgenoa.it/en/evento/genova-will-host-finish-ocean-race-europe \n",

Since 2017, the organizers of the festival are committed to a vision: a festival without waste that is achieved with the help of the national Zero waste organization for Slovenia - Ecologists without Borders. In 2019, the organizers managed to collect 93 percent of waste separately and at the same time halve the total amount. Thanks to the implemented measures, the Art Kamp has become one of the two Slovenian “zero waste” events, which are considered an example of good practice both at home and abroad.

With the help of interactive construction kits like “Street moves”, Helsingborg is testing different solutions and transforming a street by creating space for more varied activities like playgrounds, outdoor gyms, plant cultivation. Simultaneously, the project brings more life to a street by enabling the formation of social meeting points. More and more people, forgoing cars and choosing alternative transport methods, give the city greater room to explore how the streets of the future might look like. This idea is being tested right now on a street in Helsingborg where space has been set aside for seating, bike parking, greenery and lighting. This creates a new urban landscape putting people at its centre which in the long run encourages interaction between residents and visitors and creates an even more authentic experience that visitors want from a destination.

      "Description:  Dublin city is home to the Dublin Bay Biosphere which has a unique UNESCO designation, as it is the only Biosphere Reserve worldwide which includes within its area a national capital city. It recognises the biodiversity of the area, as well as the economic, cultural and tourism importance of this biodiversity, and the need for an ecologically sustainable economic model for the Biosphere.  The Biosphere was expanded in 2015, now covering the whole of Dublin Bay, extending to over 300km2. Over 300,000 people live within this newly enlarged Biosphere. The buffer zone comprises 82km2 of public and private green spaces such as parks, greenbelts, and golf courses, which surround and adjoin the core zones. The transition zone comprises 173km2 and forms the outer part of the Biosphere. It includes tourism hot spots, residential areas, harbours, ports, and industrial and commercial areas. The Biosphere has three main goals: conservation, which focuses on promoting the conservation of landscapes, habitats, wildlife, and cultural values; learning, which emphasizes supporting education and research for a better understanding of nature and global issues, and development, which aims to fostering a sustainable economy and society for people living and working in the area. It operates important programmes to help foster economic and environmental sustainability. To build on this success, the partnership has developed a five-year Conservation Programme, a five-year Research Strategy, a three-year Business Development Plan and an Education and Awareness Programme. Within the Dublin Bay Biosphere, which includes three Blue Flag beaches, are exceptional recreation areas for both Dubliners and tourists alike. Visitors who use wheelchairs can now access these amenities due to the introduction of special ‘beach wheelchairs’ which are available free of charge at North Bull Island and Dollymount Strand. For visitors, another popular way to explore the biosphere is on the award-winning Biosphere Discovery Tour which is run by Dublin Bay Cruises. Furthermore, 1600 Dublin bikes and explore the Biosphere on Dublin’s newest Coastal Mobility Route, which comprises over 3.6km of cycling and walking path along Dublin’s coastline which was opened in 2020. Since opening, the Coastal Mobility Route has become an important sustainable transport corridor for Dublin which helps to spread our visitors more sustainably throughout the city. The route is also fitted with smart sensors to measure its usage. Its success has transformed how people get around Dublin, with over 20,000 cycle trips being recorded every week, a 100% increase since 2019.\n",

      "STT: Developing the city through the eyes of tourists & citizens\n",
      "Description: Copenhagen is Denmark’s largest student city: their energy, wealth of ideas and contribution to the community, make Copenhagen a vibrant and lively and the students are invited to contribute to development of the city. In March 2021, the City of Copenhagen, the University of Copenhagen’s sustainability lab and Wonderful Copenhagen hosted the Copenhagen Sustainability Challenge. In the 24-hour case-challenge, students from 19 different nationalities and 10 universities came together to solve challenges concerning the development of sustainable tourism in Copenhagen and the Greater Copenhagen area with a special emphasis on green tourism mobility and sustainable behaviour. The results of the case- challenge presented a variety of exiting ideas concerning the development of sustainable tourism, that the city of Copenhagen will consider going forward.\n",
