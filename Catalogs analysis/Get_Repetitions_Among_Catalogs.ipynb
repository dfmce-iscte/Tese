The aim of AIR Institute's proposal is to balance tourist flows and to promote the sustainable use of natural resources. The solution is based on a decentralised system that encourages residents and tourists to visit the least-visited areas by using blockchain and smart contracts.\\nThe system works by employing oracles (a service by which a blockchain or smart contract feeds on external data outside the blockchain on which it runs) to obtain information from the Consell de Formentera's Tourism Intelligence System (TIS), where the pilot project is being carried out, and rolled out over the Alastria Network. The system is able to detect users who have changed the flow, indicating both the area and the specific incentive (establishment, event, museum, bus journey, etc.).\",\n",

The main objective of technical assistance is to develop technical assistance to support public administrations in submitting projects to the aforementioned call.\\nThe Spanish Government is promoting the Plan to Boost the Tourism Sector: moving towards safe, sustainable tourism within the framework of a transition towards a more sustainable and inclusive economic model, making the most of the sector's position as a strategic industry, and focusing efforts on making tourist destinations both safe and sustainable.\\nThe third section of the plan includes the Programme for Improving the Competitiveness of Tourist Destinations, which fundamentally aims to establish mechanisms that help make the Spanish tourism sector more competitive, decisively accelerating its transformation towards a model based on sustainability and digitalisation.\\nThe programme's objectives are to: support the conversion of tourist destinations into pioneers to maintain their appeal and competitiveness, boost the development of tourist destinations in rural and inland areas and strengthen destinations' local management entities.\\nIt is equipped with an annual budget to achieve this through annual plans, whose beneficiaries are local entities that receive the monetary transfers and which are co-financed by this programme and by their regional governments. These local entities can present their tourism sustainability plan proposals to their regional government and to SETUR. Both will assess these proposals following certain selection criteria before their definitive approval by a tourism sectoral committee and ratification by a\\u00a0tourism sectoral conference.\",\n",
