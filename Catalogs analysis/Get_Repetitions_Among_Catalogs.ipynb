      "These two solutions, although from the same company, have different focuses. The first one, called \"PRODUCT STS: SMART TOURISM AND PRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY SYSTEM,\" is aimed at providing a Smart Tourist System (STS) that caters to a specific tourism product (such as wine tourism, culture, nature, MICE, etc.). In comparison, the second solution, known as \"DESTINATION STS,\" offers an STS tailored to the specific needs of each destination, aggregating available tourism knowledge and integrating it with external data sources. Therefore, since these two solutions target different aspects of smart tourism, I would answer \"NO\" for the \"repetition\" field.\n",

This indicates that they are indeed the same solution, only described with slightly altered names and possibly categorized under different solution types.\n",
