The  solution is based on a decentralised system that encourages  residents and tourists to visit the least-visited areas by using  blockchain and smart contracts.The system works by employing oracles (a service by which  a blockchain or smart contract feeds on external data outside  the blockchain on which it runs) to obtain information from the  Consell de Formentera's Tourism Intelligence System (TIS),  where the pilot project is being carried out, and rolled out over  the Alastria Network.

Assistance design is done visually by moving objects in a  fundamentally graphical application that allows reasoning  according to the ultimate meaning of the user's needs. 2. Capacity for developed dialogue. If it receives complete  information about the topic of interest, it will provide the  information designed, and if it receives partial information,  it will proactively request it using an appropriate dialogue.3. If the assistant is waiting for a particular dialogue, it is able  to remind the user if they go off at a tangent or launch  another query by way of a parenthesis.4. Situations in which the citizen is disappointed by the  quality of assistance are minimised, as the assistant almost  never responds in a totally unrelated way. If there is no  planned response, the assistant can respond by explaining  aspects related to the query about which it does have  information. In this regard, if the citizen doesn't manage to  find the information they want, the assistant will be asked  to search for it, and the organisation can rearrange the  content of its website to provide this type of information.5.

This leads to interventions that are more  accurate, exact and effective.The apps rely on an exhaustive, thorough data collection  process, supported by technology and based on their own  method. This method was developed using the most relevant  regulatory documents on accessibility in urban public spaces  and checked with accessibility experts, technicians and  associations.The Urban Accessibility Manager allows consultation  and analysis of the main parameters that establish the  accessibility of a crossing or section of a pedestrian route,  and its Degree of Accessibility as a summary indicator. It is also possible to carry out analyses of the Degree of Accessibility or of a specific regulatory parameter within the  pedestrian network, in either one or several urban areas, or  on a specific route, as well as comparative analyses between  urban areas by means of the Average Degree of Accessibility  indicator.The app facilitates data network maintenance in a simple  setting that is particularly user-friendly for those who are not  used to GIS software.The Urban Accessibility Manager is especially focused on  the work of local managers and technicians within the town  planning, transportation, urban sustainability, accessibility,  construction, social services and tourism sectors.",

Having mechanisms available that allow  tourist destinations to analyse their visitors (how many they  receive, what they're like, where they come from, and their  reason for visiting) has become essential, so destinations can  make decisions to improve or optimise tourist attractions in  the short and medium term.Tourism managers have customer service points for visitors  spread all over the area under their care: information offices,  monuments, visitor centres, tour guides, etc. All of these  points generally collect tourist data, which is usually limited  to the day of the visit, the number of people, and their place  of origin. Previously, this data would at best be combined  manually or on an Excel spreadsheet to create sporadic  reports.The Tourist Information Segmentation Platform improves the  processes used to gather and analyse information, while also  providing the main tourism manager with full, centralised  control.It consists of a mobile app which dynamically gathers  information from the different customer service points, and  features a platform that allows the management of these  points and their users. It receives all the information, analyses  it, and creates automatic reports based on date range, type  of information point, or specific information point.This technological development can achieve the following objectives:\u2022  Replace paper-based collection of data\u2022  Increase the amount of data collected\u2022  Automatically generate tourism reports\u2022  Automate the management of information based on pre- configured tourism reports\u2022  Reduce the time spent gathering and processing  information\u2022  Preserve the privacy of information collected about visitors\u2022  Create an image of modernity for visitors and tourists",

This is done by centralising  the information on free spaces available in the different  parking areas (rotation, blue zone and park and ride), and it is  shown to the user through information panels in the city and  on mobile applications. These apps guide the user directly to  the parking space selected.DINYPARK - TrafficIt aims to improve the mobility and efficiency of public  transport infrastructure and systems in the city.This data allows measures to be taken to improve traffic and  to have statistical information on the use of the roads (time  slots, type of vehicles, days of the week).Smart cameras provide access to relevant traffic information  (vehicle count and classification, saturation level, automatic  detection of incidents on public roads).DINYPARK - TrackingThe aim is to ascertain the most common vehicle routes,  their origin (source/destination matrices) and frequency  of movement through certain points, control access to  restricted spaces and detect violations (inappropriate  parking, prohibited manoeuvres).DINYPARK - PRMThis aims to facilitate parking for people with reduced  mobility (PRM).",

It also displays repetitive users showing how frequently  they appear. With the use of wireless technologies (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth  signals from mobile devices), the position of the devices is obtained through triangulation. This leads to the generation  of heat maps, and information about frequency and travel  times between different points.

This  technology allows two applications for tourist destinations in  sand and water. The application of biotechnology on beaches is centred on  three uses:1. Elimination of biological remains on dog-friendly  beaches. The bacteria and enzymes act on biological  remains, decomposing the chain compounds into simple  molecules, thus eliminating not only biological remains,  but also odours.2. Treatment of seaweed. Many town councils pile up the  seaweed that washes up along the coast, generating  unpleasant smells and annoyance to holidaymakers.  Biotechnological treatment makes the seaweed  composting time much quicker, removing larvae,  mosquitoes and, above all, the bad smells from decaying  seaweed.3. Stains from petroleum products. In the event of the  appearance of diesel or tar stains, biotechnology allows  the hydrocarbon molecules to break them down, not only  at a surface level, but to penetrate the earth by removing  the remains to a depth of up to approximately 4 metres.

However, the greater the increase in  the volume of data, the harder it is to separate relevant information  from irrelevant data. Moreover, this approach does not enable  future scenarios or situations that do not appear in the data to  be assessed.

Geolocation: these resources are identified in the  destination through online maps, organised in layers of  themed information.3.  Integration: the information is developed and integrated  in its different formats - text (explanatory texts about the  resources and the general narrative), photos (recent and old), illustrations and video images (promotional videos),  audio guides (narrations of the texts), 3D models (digital  recreations), virtual reality (360\u00ba photos), augmented reality,  educational guides, mobile apps, websites, digital games,  leaflets, signs, informative panels and QR codes.4.

To do this, Inventrip has  a technology that allows hierarchical data networks to be  established with different levels of integration (thematic,  administrative, etc.). Inventrip already has 40,000 resources  for its level of integration on the Iberian Peninsula. Inventrip allows the main IoT digital connectors (dynamic  QR, NFC chips, beacons and Geofencing) to be managed in  the cloud to send digital information to tourists' mobiles at all  times and based on their location, particularly through smart  signage.Inventrip can share the entire destination, a thematic route  or a resource, all through URLs. It also features booking  engines to sell tourist activities and URLs with high-resolution  digital tourism viewpoints and virtual tours. The Inventrip  service is also integrated into touch terminals and allows the  management, visualisation and downloading of trail KMLs. To promote the interoperability of platforms and the  distribution of tourism data, a common language is needed.  In tourism this translates into compliance with the UNE  178503 Semantic Standard of Smart Tourism Destinations.

The platform allows any space to be communicate with  local residents in a personalised and effective way. It also  understands user interactions, interests and behaviour, and  so is able to assist with decision making regarding different  spaces, and the governance of Smart Destinations.Smart QR codes on any device and in any locationThrough unBlock smart QR codes, each tourist has a  different, personalised experience. Venues and businesses  can discover their potential audience, and decide which  content they wish to show to each type of profile. The unBlock app is able to distinguish who is scanning it in  order to offer them content in line with their interests. In other  words, two people will receive different information from the  same QR code, based on what they like.  Management for spaces and citiesThrough a unique user ID, unBlock provides public and  private spaces with services like access and capacity control  and notification management to give the managers and  visitors in a space or city more powerful management and  communication capabilities in real time.   Qualified data platformThe integration of different data sources and the steady  collection of data via the constant use of the app by tourists  in the city results in both in a better user experience for these  tourists and highly qualified data that covers interactions, use  of services, the target audience's interests and information  about tourist flows, enabling the tourist destinations and  spaces using unBlock can make better decisions.",

URBIM gathers all the information together within  one environment, providing and consuming information that  will create the future asset.It is designed to be scalable in two ways. Firstly, its growth  in the different levels of usability in different non-sealed  modules which will be the platform's verticals.  Secondly, it  is scalable within the geometric definition of the BIM model  itself, as well as in terms of the extension proposed in the  project and the information provided in the different modules  and connections.  All the information is stored in the cloud, and is therefore  accessible from different locations, both online and on the  app, to improve the consumption of information.Within URBIM, the results of the information analysed can be  stratified in a personalised way to meet the needs of each  user, which are always different.

The solution provides  knowledge on the status of the garbage bins, allowing for  more efficient collection. The solution moves municipalities  away from a reactive, static collection model based on  historical values towards a more proactive and innovative  method. Quamtra measures and transmits the status or fill  level of each bin, allowing for more efficient planning by only  collecting full or nearly full bins.The IoT solution proposed by Quamtra Smart Waste  Management is based on smart devices (the Q and MiniQ  Sensors) installed inside waste bins. These sensors constantly  measure the fill level using a measurement module based on  ultrasound. In the same way, the sensors collect parameters  such as the bins' interior temperature, tilt, movement and  even location.The information collected by these sensors is sent to a  software platform that compiles, conveniently displays, and  analyses the data. The platform creates multiple reports and  alerts that allow for agile analysis and decision making by  responsible parties.Quamtra sensors are compatible with all currently available  waste container models.",
