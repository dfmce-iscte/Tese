Traffic congestion, pollution and providing a safe environment from COVID-19 raise serious concerns, especially in large cities.\nThe solution offers:\n\nTraveller safety: Real-time search for weapons among travellers with image capture and immediate warning.\nDetection of vehicles, animals or people using the cameras already installed.\nAbility to derive insights and value from bus, infrastructure and operations data. It means automatically collecting and transmitting vehicle data, providing the operator with an up- to-date view of the fleet.\nSocial distancing: This solution faces the challenge of collecting insights from the cameras already available throughout the city using artificial intelligence, for more intelligent management and communication between the local government and citizens.\nCompiling insights through cameras is a challenge that requires the generation of algorithms and the training of specialised artificial intelligence models. In one of their success stories, while respecting anonymity, they monitor the number of people inside the buses to inform of the bus capacity at the next stop.\nAnother use case is to report the detection of groups of people in public places according to legal regulations.\nAs a result of the implementation, the city will have real-time information and predictions of the proposed indicators.\nThe information will be visible through the information display system integrated with other data sources and accessible through open data portals.\nThe ultimate goal of mobility in smart cities is safety and quality of life. These benefits translate into a city with less wasted time and more resources to invest in productive initiatives, both at the municipal and individual citizen levels.\n",

NADIA DTI provides destinations with a monitoring tool that also allows initial diagnoses to be performed, and the important indicators to be focused on. It\u00a0is a multi-user solution that allows goals and targets to be set. The destination's management team can thus divide up the monitoring and supervision tasks for each indicator. Its powerful dashboard, divided into categories, uses a traffic light system to indicate how close each goal is to being met. Moreover, thanks to its powerful graphics system, users can see how indicators evolve over time, or check real-time information about their status.

The involvement of direct and indirect agents, the in-depth study of the potential areas and the alignment with the 2030 Agenda and with the objectives of Spain's Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan are core axes when carrying out these projects.\nThese are projects intended to increase the competitiveness of the business and public sector, improve the visitor experience and the quality of life of residents.\n\nStrategic Tourism Plans: identifying the starting situation, characterising the destination and developing an action strategy, to raise the destination's profile.\nTourism Sustainability Plans: in charge of the entire process.\n",

There, the company makes segmented content available to its network of ambassadors for each group of people, which they can read and share on their social media in just a few clicks. The scope of this content is multiplied and generates greater acceptance and credibility on social media, since it is shared by people who are part of the company.\nAnother key to the success of BeAmbassador is its possibilities to inspire and gamify the ambassadors. The platform features several modules solely focused on this objective: ambassador ranking, challenges, competitions and, of course, incentive system.",

In this proposal, the term \"Usability\" is applied to public space as the correspondence between the number of users and the percentage of occupied area, and the physical conditions of the space, as they show how the space responds to the needs of people through the decisions made in its design.\nThe smart artificial vision systems designed and manufactured by Bosch make it possible to take reliable measurements 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, and to differentiate between people, bicycles, motorcycles, cars, buses or lorries, which provides an exceptional empirical system for city managers. Other systems for measuring the number of people and the occupancy percentage (such as the analysis of the geolocation of mobile terminals, whether by Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or 3G/4G/5G connectivity) are based on population estimates. Therefore, they do not offer data with as much information and precision as artificial vision. However, the possibility of integrating data from different sources will always bring greater richness to the project.\nThanks to the Privacy Mode in Bosch smart cameras, they can be configured as video sensors that protect personal data and, consequently, be deployed in public spaces without the need for permission from video surveillance committees: the purpose of these video sensors is not security; it is the measurement of anonymous movements in an area of the smart city or territory.",

This leads to interventions that are more accurate, exact and effective.\nThe apps rely on an exhaustive, thorough data collection process, supported by technology and based on their own method. This method was developed using the most relevant regulatory documents on accessibility in urban public spaces and checked with accessibility experts, technicians and associations.\nThe Urban Accessibility Manager allows consultation and analysis of the main parameters that establish the accessibility of a crossing or section of a pedestrian route, and its Degree of Accessibility as a summary indicator.\nIt is also possible to carry out analyses of the Degree of Accessibility or of a specific regulatory parameter within the pedestrian network, in either one or several urban areas, or on a specific route, as well as comparative analyses between urban areas by means of the Average Degree of Accessibility indicator.\nThe app facilitates data network maintenance in a simple setting that is particularly user-friendly for those who are not used to GIS software.\nThe Urban Accessibility Manager is especially focused on the work of local managers and technicians within the town planning, transportation, urban sustainability, accessibility, construction, social services and tourism sectors.",

Having mechanisms available that allow tourist destinations to analyse their visitors (how many they receive, what they're like, where they come from, and their reason for visiting) has become essential, so destinations can make decisions to improve or optimise tourist attractions in the short and medium term.\nTourist managers have visitor service points distributed across their area of management: information offices, monuments, visitor centres, tourist guides, etc. From all these points, a series of tourist data is generally collected, which is limited in most cases to the day of the visit, the number of people and the origin.

It receives all the information, analyses it, and creates automatic reports based on date range, type of information point, or specific information point.\nThis technological development can achieve the following objectives:\n\nReplace paper-based collection of data.\nIncrease the amount of data collected.\nAutomatically generate tourism reports.\nAutomate the management of information based on pre- configured tourism reports.\nReduce the time spent gathering and processing information.\nPreserve the privacy of information collected about visitors.\nCreate an image of modernity for visitors and tourists.\n",

Therefore, this area requires highly specialist knowledge.\nUsage and security management: every heritage element in use must find a sustainable relationship with the behaviour and attitudes of tourists, users and managers, who enjoy it. This use must remain conditioned by the presence of cultural assets, which form the basis of the heritage nature of the management.\n\nAn appropriate strategy for smart heritage management will improve the conservation of cultural assets and increase their durability.

However, the greater the increase in the volume of data, the harder it is to separate relevant information from irrelevant data. Moreover, this approach does not enable future scenarios or situations that do not appear in the data to be assessed.

This information is displayed through a geoportal using a map as a communication tool between the connected tourist and the destination.\nThe technology used is through a website that can be viewed correctly on mobile devices, since it is necessary to use the technology in a differentiated way given that the use of a website or a mobile phone may differ depending on the travel phase of the tourist:\n\nIn the inspiration and booking phase the tourist predominantly browses on websites, so the website will focus on providing an overview of the tourist destination they are searching for information on in the tourist space that they want to go to.\nIn the experience phase the tourist uses a mobile phone, so it will place them directly with the GPS in the area where they are located and the nearest tourist spaces with their characteristics. The web technology will adapt to the mobile to enhance their experience and make it very simple and practical to use.\nIn the post-trip phase the tourist will be able to use both tools (web and app) to identify where they have been, sharing it on their social networks, and looking for other similar places that offer them the same confidence and security.\n",

By putting on a pair of VR glasses, the tourist enters an immersive experience which transports them in time and space. For example, a coastal village may wish to show how the sea has influenced their way of life for millennia. They can recreate a 2nd century CE Roman boat returning from a fishing trip in 3D, showing what the coastline looked like at the time and the buildings and temples it featured. These experiences take tourists to the heart of the action thanks to immersive VR.",

URBIM gathers all the information together within one environment, providing and consuming information that will create the future asset.\nIt is designed to be scalable in two ways. Firstly, its growth in the different levels of usability in different non-sealed modules which will be the platform's verticals. Secondly, it is scalable within the geometric definition of the BIM model itself, as well as in terms of the extension proposed in the project and the information provided in the different modules and connections.\nAll the information is stored in the cloud, and is therefore accessible from different locations, both online and on the app, to improve the consumption of information.\nWithin URBIM, the consumers of this data are important (e.g.\u00a0managers, citizens, tourists, service providers).

The solution provides knowledge on the status of the garbage bins, allowing for more efficient collection. The solution moves municipalities away from a reactive, static collection model based on historical values towards a\u00a0 more proactive and innovative method. Quamtra measures and transmits the status or fill level of each bin, allowing for more efficient planning by only collecting full or nearly full bins.\nThe IoT solution proposed by Quamtra Smart Waste Management is based on smart devices (the Q and MiniQ Sensors) installed inside waste bins. These sensors constantly measure the fill level using a measurement module based on ultrasound. In the same way, the sensors collect parameters such as the bins' interior temperature, tilt, movement and even location.\nThe information collected by these sensors is sent to a software platform that compiles, conveniently displays, and analyses the data. The platform creates multiple reports and alerts that allow for agile analysis and decision making by responsible parties.\nQuamtra sensors are compatible with all currently available garbage container models.",
