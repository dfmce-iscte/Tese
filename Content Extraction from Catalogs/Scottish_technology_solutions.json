For over 30 years they have helped sites across the world create compelling interpretation through inspiring audio and multimedia tours. They offer a full service solution from content creation right through to the hardware itself.  \nIn the UK they work with a diverse range of sites, such as Blenheim Palace, Edinburgh Castle, Warner Bros the Harry Potter Studio Tour, The Beatles Story, Titanic Belfast etc.\n<strong>Supporting the industry during Covid19:</strong>\nAs a way to show support for the industry during Covid19, Antenna International are offering to turn your existing audio or multimedia tours into a virtual tour experience that your visitors can access while stuck at home, for free for the duration of your site closure.  \nIf you don\u2019t have an existing tour don\u2019t worry, Antenna can use any digital assets you have (images, photos, videos, on website, or YouTube, etc) and create a \u201cprogressive web app\u201d. \n<strong>The Antenna Progressive Web App (PWA) and re-opening:</strong>\nThe PWA can help sites in many ways post re opening. Here are just a few ideas around how Antenna International can help address the new practices most attractions expect to adopt as they remobilise through a PWA:\n<ul><li> Restrictions to guided tours - how about getting your wonderful tour guides to record their tour and uploading this to the PWA? Visitors, on arrival, can then access the tour via the PWA and receive a truly authentic welcome with a virtual guided tour of the attraction.</li><li> Reduced capacity - the PWA is perfect for providing remote tours, meaning you can still provide a virtual visitor experience to those visitors who cannot come to your site. This allows you to continue engaging with your loyal visitors and encourage them to return another time.</li><li> Social distancing - you can add a message in your PWA to ensure that all visitors are aware of the social distancing measures, and this content can also keep your visitors entertained / engaged whilst queuing.</li><li> A contactless environment - the PWA is provided as a QR code or web link, this allows you to make it entirely contactless. Or if you wish, even send them a pre-visit teaser.</li><li> Pre-visit information - to reduce your visitors\u2019 concerns and to ensure they follow essential guidelines, you could send them information on your new hygiene measures, routes around site, and facilities available. Antenna International, cont. </li><li> Fundraising and Membership promotion - visitors will be all too aware of the negative impact the Covid19 pandemic is having on our industry. For those visitors that are keen to help, the PWA can offer instructions on how to donate or join membership schemes, and even highlight retail opportunities on-site.</li><li> Visitor flow - you can use the PWA to implement multiple linear routes around your site (with a different QR code for each), advising that visitors follow each \u2018stop\u2019 to ensure a controlled route.</li><li> Outdoor Sites - as we know, these are to be the first to open, the PWA allows you to maintain communication with visitors even if you are not there to supervise them. Visitors can access a QR code on display / sent to them and can then use their phone to guide them around the site, even if there is no Wi-Fi.</li></ul><strong>How does a Progressive Web App compare to a native app?</strong>\nUnlike a traditional app, a PWA is...\n<ul><li> Quicker: Does not download and loads faster than a mobile site</li><li> Easier: Does not need to be installed</li><li> Lighter: Does not require any storage space on the device</li><li> More compatible: Doesn't need an iOS &amp;amp; Android version</li><li> More convenient: Doesn't need to go through App stores</li></ul><strong>Timeline:</strong>\nAntenna can create the free version of the PWA using your existing content within seven days. For an audio or multimedia tour including creating the content from scratch the timescales are approximately six weeks however, this will vary based on how much content is being created.\n<strong>Costs:</strong>\nThe free offer for the PWA comes with no catches and is valid for the duration of your site being closed. After this time and your site re-opens, Antenna will work with you on potential solutions for your interpretation, using the PWA, hand held guides or a combination of both. They will work on the best solution for you, your visitors and your budgets.\n<strong>Contact details:</strong>\nIf you think Antenna might be of help, please contact Laura Szuca: \nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:lszuca@antennainternational.com\">lszuca@antennainternational.com</a>\n</p>"

All kinds of tourism businesses can benefit from using SeekBeak \u2013 whether it be virtual trade shows, museums, retail shops or tour venues. Their clients range from historical churches to fortune 500 companies.\nHaving a virtual experience allows people to engage and interact with their customers, or their audience, in way that has not been possible in the past. Especially now, when more people are looking online to gain confidence in a product or in a space. \nWith their Tour Guide option, they give attractions the ability to guide people through their experiences in real time. A virtual experience is also the best way to entice and inform your audience about your business, but also it is the best way to experience your business when you cannot be physically there. \n<strong>Using SeekBeak for destination marketing:</strong>\nJust as brochures and videos have been used for years to instil a sense of wanderlust in potential visitors - an interactive tour will likely encourage a deeper connection with the place; and most people will not be satisfied simply by experiencing it virtually. Nothing (yet) is a replacement for the real thing!\nUsing SeakBeak as a tool for destination marketing allows people unprecedented access to a location/project in detail wherever they are in the world. \nSeakBeak interactive tours offer the viewer a chance to familiarize themselves with a place. The experience can also offer a new means of learning about a destination for potential visitors and individuals who aren't able to travel but want to be exposed to the world afar. The interactive tour can offer an inroad to information and breakdown any barriers or misconceptions people may have about a place. \nexperiences \u2013 SeekBeak, cont. \nVisitors are planning their trips in great detail from the comfort of their own home, they also like to share information about experiences on social media. SeakBeak tours offer a highly personalized and sharable travel planning experience.\n<strong>Timeline: </strong>\nDue to the flexibility of their services, it\u2019s hard to specify the amount of time it takes to create a tour. You could technically get one going in 5 minutes, but you could also take months if you wanted to do things like capture an attraction in different seasons, do before / after shots etc. Some projects keep adding updates for years.\n<strong>Cost: </strong>\nPricing is available from Free, Individual, Small Business and customisable at an Enterprise level plan: \n<a href=\"https://seekbeak.com/pricing/\">https://seekbeak.com/pricing/</a>\n<strong>Contact details:</strong>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:info@seekbeak.com\">info@seekbeak.com</a>\n</p>",

        "text": "<p>View360 Scotland Ltd, based in Airdrie, has been providing solutions to businesses who wish to showcase their premises or facilities online, since 2008.\nThey provide 360 degree and 3D virtual tour photography, allowing the viewer to literally walk through the facility at their own leisure and pace. Combining this service with video and general still photography, it provides a one-stop shop solution for creating imagery for a client\u2019s website.\nNot only do they create the 3D virtual tours, but they also provide a dedicated online platform to showcase the tours directly to your clients and prospects. This is done in the form of a Zoom-like meeting but is hosted directly from the facility in question. The host can spend time understanding the clients\u2019 needs and present in real time, the features and benefits of their venue or facility.\nThis service is available to anyone with a need to showcase their venue in order to generate revenue \u2013 this would work for a number of different types of premises, including leisure centres, distilleries, museums, hotels, wedding facilities, house builders, bars and restaurants.\n<strong>Examples:</strong>\nAs an example \u2013 they are currently working with a distillery in the north of Scotland, whose visitor numbers have gone from 15,000 per year to zero. They are creating an online walkthrough version of the tour, which can be accessed via the client\u2019s website (either free or fee paying) which as well as the client\u2019s ability to \u2018walk\u2019 the actual tour, will include additional written, photographic and video content. It can also be by invitation and hosted by the Visitor Manager, who can have up to 50 people online with them on the tour at any one time. This provides a real time, face-to-face opportunity to increase brand awareness, present the operation and a sales opportunity directly to their online store.\nAnother example would be Cala Homes, who now utilise the service for doing online viewings of their properties. They see this as a long term solution to doing viewings, which can now be done 24/7, from anywhere to anywhere and does not limit the number of viewers that can physically access their show homes.\nA few examples: \nNew Build Show home -<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2WhOgKu\">https://bit.ly/2WhOgKu</a>\nHotel -<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2uiMDkf\">https://bit.ly/2uiMDkf</a>\nPub -<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2OuCbmj\">https://bit.ly/2OuCbmj</a>\nPenthouse Hotel Room -<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2qDSodB\">https://bit.ly/2qDSodB</a>\ntour \u2013 View360 Scotland, cont. \n<strong>Timeline:</strong>\nThe solution can be in place within a week of doing the necessary photography and scanning, which normally takes one or two days, depending on the size of the facility and the complexity of post-production work.\n<strong>Cost: </strong>\nThe price varies dependant on the size of the facility, the length of time required for scanning and the post-production work required.\nFor new build property, it\u2019s in the range of \u00a3500 to \u00a31000 per completed property (1000 to 2500 square foot range). Their largest project was a 46,000 square foot facility, which was in the region of \u00a36,500.\nEach project is treated individually, and a visit takes place before submitting their proposal, to establish the customer\u2019s requirements and the work required.\nAnyone accessing the website will find an opening page, allowing you to add your details and receive a 25% discount on your first order.\n<strong>Contact details: </strong>\nContact person: John Robinson \nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:john@v360scotland.net\">john@v360scotland.net</a>\nTel: 07515 966 012\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://view360online.co.uk/\">https://view360online.co.uk</a>\n</p>",

This means you can track and assess the success of your codes and even edit or update them with new or more relevant content.\nTo do so, Dynamic QR Codes use what is called a short URL which redirects users to your desired landing page. This short URL collects statistics about the number of scans, the place, date and time of a scan, as well as the operating system used for each scan.\nIn their paid plans, it's possible to edit Dynamic QR Codes even after they have already been printed. This means you have more flexibility and can change the encoded content, website, and even function of a Dynamic QR Code anytime.\n<strong>Static QR Codes:</strong>\nStatic QR codes don't have these features. They just redirect to your content or page with no possibility to edit or see how much your code is being used.\nYou can read more about the benefits of Dynamic QR Codes in their eBook by clicking<a href=\"http://www.qr-code-generator.com/qr-code-marketing/more-information-more-flexibility/\">here</a>.\n<strong>Cost: </strong>\nTheir plans vary depending on the number of Dynamic QR Codes you need to keep. Please see below for information about their paid plans:\n<ul><li> Starter Plan - includes 2 Dynamic QR Codes, unlimited Static QR Codes, and statistics for the first 10,000 scans for \u20ac60 annually.</li><li> Advanced Plan - includes 50 Dynamic QR Codes, unlimited Static QR Codes, and unlimited scan statistics for \u20ac150 annually.</li><li> Professional Plan - for those who want to use all the features of the QRCG Pro Software.

Galaxy can sell capacity managed and timed tickets to help attractions and experience providers seamlessly control the number of guests who enter your venue during any specific time-period. With Galaxy\u2019s web store component, attractions can sell these tickets online and e-deliver them to their guests for scanning and validation at the gate, providing a contactless solution that reduces lines and social distancing risks at the entrance.\nWhen tickets go back on sale for re-opening, or when attractions release more capacity online, there is a surge in online traffic that risks crashing the site. Gateway Ticketing offers load balancing and online queueing solutions to manage this traffic so the ticket sales are saved and the online purchasing guest experience remains positive.\nWith their Reporting Plus module, all the purchase data collected by Galaxy POS is aggregated, organised and automatically delivered in easy to understand reports. Quickly reference the number of tickets sold for a certain day or time period in the future. Pull entry and exit scans to determine capacity and dwell time on the fly. Run financial reports to analyze the balance between profit and new limited capacity.\nWith their CRM Plus solution, attractions can also collect all the behavioural data from the Galaxy POS and use it to run targeted marketing campaigns. \n<ul><li> Pre-visit: send auto-generated emails to members / passholders or guests who have purchased admission with updated cleanliness and safety procedures. </li><li> Post-visit: send auto-generated emails with a promotion to encourage repeat visits, or to share an experience via social, or with a survey to gather guest sentiment.</li></ul><strong>Cost and timeline:</strong>\nThey have worked on short or long timelines for different types of projects.

But as we start to come to terms with the fact that the virus will be with us a little longer than we would like, we need to start thinking about how we can adapt our businesses and venues while returning to some sort of \u2018new normal\u2019 and keeping everyone safe at the same time.\nHere\u2019s where Studio Souffl\u00e9 can help. Below are just a few examples of how their range of inflatable structures and bespoke solutions can be used to help with social distancing.\n<strong>Additional spaces for conferences and talks:</strong>\nStudio Souffle offer a range of medium to large inflatable structures are an easy and quick way to add extra capacity to any event while still maintaining social distancing. These can be popped up in the carpark when needed for instance. The inflatable structures are quick and easy to set up and also pack down to a fraction of its inflated size so can be stored easily when not in use.\n<strong>Additional space for caf\u00e9's and restaurants:</strong>\nAdditional spaces can also be added for caf\u00e9s and restaurants where extra outdoor space is available for example, in parks and attractions or even a parking lot. For example their Canap\u00e9 structure from their Regular Fries range which comes with optional clear screens. The Canap\u00e9 comes in a range of sizes and is open and airy while still providing protection from the elements.\n<strong>Pop-up covers for longer queuing times:</strong>\nWith extra measures being implemented before entering a venue, park or building such as temperature checks, form filling, etc; the queues and waiting times are expected to get longer. And from what we can see outside of supermarkets already with the 1-2m gap between patrons, the queues are much longer than normal. Keep your patrons comfortable and protected while they wait with their modular Canap\u00e9 structures which can be zipped together to create longer tunnels. The sides are open to keep it cool inside.\n<strong>Break-out spaces in large exhibition settings:</strong>\nBreak up large spaces and limit the number of people in each break-out space at any one time. Create a flow of movement map for visitors to follow to minimise bottlenecks and overcrowding. Their pop-up structures such as the Airspace and the Octagon Office from their Bitesize range are perfect for this.\n<strong>Hand sanitising stations:</strong>\nAs much as parks and attractions are well equipped with toilets and washrooms, it is still not ideal for the amount of times and frequency we are advised to wash and sanitize our hands. Their pop-up Airspaces are perfect for popping up hand sanitizing stations around the area.\nSouffle, cont.  \n<strong>Pop-up drive thru extensions:</strong>\nCreate temporary Drive-Thru extensions for your shop, restaurant or caf\u00e9 to provide click and collect services and minimize walk-in customers. Work with the team at Studio Souffl\u00e9 to design a custom structure to suit your needs.\n<strong>Why inflatables?</strong>\nBelow are a few good reasons why you should choose inflatables: \n<ul><li> Quick and easy to set up</li><li> Packs away small for easy storage and transport</li><li> Doesn\u2019t require bulky metalwork</li><li> Can be customised with your logo and brand colours</li><li> Can be made in pretty much any shape to best represent your brand</li></ul>These are only a few examples of how the inflatable structures can be used. They are essentially versatile shells that can be adapted to various scenarios.\n<strong>Timeline:</strong>\nStudio Souffl\u00e9 generally take 6-8 weeks to develop and produce a bespoke product.\n<strong>Cost:</strong>\nCost will depend on the size and complexity of the project. A smaller structure like a wall can cost under \u00a31000, a pod costs around \u00a31000 (based on a small structure) or over for a larger structure.\n<strong>Contact for enquiries:</strong>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:hello@studiosouffle.com\">hello@studiosouffle.com</a>\nPhone: 020 7998 4950\nWebsite:<a href=\"http://www.studiosouffle.com/\">www.studiosouffle.com</a>\n</p>",
