The tramway is a major part of the commuter infrastructure and provides alternative transport to large-scale events at the University, stadium, or concert areas in and around the city. In 2023 Odense Letbane, the company behind the tramway, started to collaborate with local events, such as \u2018Sportsl\u00f8rdag\u2019 and \u2018Eventyrl\u00f8bet\u2019 to offer free transportation for participants at the events. The tramway is considered the most inclusive and accessible transportation, due in no small part to the accessibility group that provided consultation during the planning and construction of the tram. The accessibility group, formed by Odense Letbane, consisted of people with different disabilities or special needs who spoke on behalf of relevant interest organisations. The result is a unique insight into which accessibility features we must implement on the tram and at tram stations.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out more via: &lt;a href=\"https://www.odenseletbane.dk/english\"&gt;https://www.odenseletbane.dk/english&lt;/a&gt;</p>"

In Bremerhaven, municipal and private housing companies have renovated various residential buildings from the 1950s and 1960s with innovative energy-saving concepts. An online solar register is freely available to citizens to inform them about the solar potential of their roofs. Almost all Bremerhaven schools participate in the \u20183\u20444 plus\u2019 energy-saving project, educating children about climate protection. The pupils discuss problems and connections between energy, resource consumption and climate change in class while their caretakers check the consumption of electricity, heat and water and implement technical energy efficiency measures at home. The project facilitates learning and testing of energy-saving and &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;22 climate-friendly behaviour in everyday school life. Based on the energy and water consumption, the participating schools receive an annual bonus of up to 2,500 euros.    &lt;br&gt;Find out more via: &lt;a href=\"https://www.bremerhaven.de/sustainability\"&gt;https://www.bremerhaven.de/sustainability&lt;/a&gt;</p>"
