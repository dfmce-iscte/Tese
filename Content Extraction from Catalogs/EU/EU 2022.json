The wristband can be shown to any Dublin Airport staff member at security or passport control or any area where help is required, enhancing the visitor experience to the airport and city. Additionally, DAA provides a sensory room to calm passengers who might feel overwhelmed in a busy airport. Designed for passengers with autism, dementia, cognitive impairment, or other special needs the room has been very successful. Among other innovations are an assistance dog relief room, and induction loop amplification points around the airport for passengers with hearing difficulties. In 2020 DAA and Hack Access held an accessibility hackathon focused on improving the customer experience for passengers with accessibility challenges.

The PEBA analyses the municipal area from the point of view of motor and sensory accessibility, dividing it into 94 Areas, i.e. portions of the territory where public functions of importance and interest for the citizen are concentrated, returning a map with 4 colors depending on the degree of presence or absence of architectural barriers: green (accessible), yellow (partially accessible), orange (partially inaccessible) and red (inaccessible). A very important aspect to underline is that Genoa is the first Italian city with a totally georeferenced PEBA and with data free and accessible to all on dedicated portals (open data). For tours and maps, the relative level of accessibility has been indicated for the main points of interest in Genoa, such as monuments, museums, universities or historical shops.

Kimap allows users with mobility difficulties to find the most accessible and suitable path to reach destinations. The app provides 4 tour guides with historical-artistic itineraries connected to city mapping in open data for barrier-free tourism to explore the city in complete autonomy. The maps are constantly updated thanks to modern techniques for detecting road surfaces providing real-time information and optimizing navigation for people with wheelchairs, electric hand-bikes and scooters, family with baby strollers (updating accessible routes automatically, time and distance, providing voice assistant).  Moreover, while used, Kimap automatically detects data and collects inputs from the users\u2019 community. Bottom-up actions to co-create accessibility mapping by using information from the users, who become themselves data\u2019 collectors, ensuring an easy and timely update with reasonable investment. In addition, crowd-mapping events permit the involvement of different mappers including associations and committees of people with disabilities in order to cover a large part of the city (e.g. crowd-mapping experience in the Anconella Park led to the identification of the interventions improving the accessibility to the area).

The sustainability programme brings together a range of tangible ways that will positively impact the marine environment such as rolling out initiatives for cleaner, healthier seas and a learning programme. Genoa as host city makes use of the Ocean Race by contributing vital scientific data to aid the understanding of ocean health and the effects of climate change by using our race boats to collect valuable data on sea surface temperature and ocean acidification. Moreover, the city will ensure that every element of the race village is sustainably produced: from being free of single-use plastic to the seafood served on site and invite people who visit the events to help protect the ocean. In overall, the city will use the Ocean Race Summits series as an occasion to change the way people behave towards the ocean for good. It will therefore host innovation workshops for sailing clubs and offer learning programmes for adults and schoolchildren about the issues affecting the ocean. When in June 2021 the Ocean Race arrived in Genoa, the whole race village was powered by 100% renewable energy and the Race was climate positive, supported by blue carbon projects. This will inspire others to act on climate change.

Since 2017, the organizers of the festival are committed to a vision: a festival without waste that is achieved with the help of the national Zero waste organization for Slovenia - Ecologists without Borders. In 2019, the organizers managed to collect 93 percent of waste separately and at the same time halve the total amount. Thanks to the implemented measures, the Art Kamp has become one of the two Slovenian \u201czero waste\u201d events, which are considered an example of good practice both at home and abroad. It is also planned that other events will also join the zero-waste events initiative, such as the Ceremonial Harvest of the World\u2019s Oldest Vine and St. Martin\u2019s Day in Maribor.

Simultaneously, the project brings more life to a street by enabling the formation of social meeting points. More and more people, forgoing cars and choosing alternative transport methods, give the city greater room to explore how the streets of the future might look like. This idea is being tested right now on a street in Helsingborg where space has been set aside for seating, bike parking, greenery and lighting. This creates a new urban landscape putting people at its centre which in the long run encourages interaction between residents and visitors and creates an even more authentic experience that visitors want from a destination.

The Biosphere has three main goals: conservation, which focuses on promoting the conservation of landscapes, habitats, wildlife, and cultural values; learning, which emphasizes supporting education and research for a better understanding of nature and global issues, and development, which aims to fostering a sustainable economy and society for people living and working in the area. It operates important programmes to help foster economic and environmental sustainability. To build on this success, the partnership has developed a five-year Conservation Programme, a five-year Research Strategy, a three-year Business Development Plan and an Education and Awareness Programme. Within the Dublin Bay Biosphere, which includes three Blue Flag beaches, are exceptional recreation areas for both Dubliners and tourists alike. Visitors who use wheelchairs can now access these amenities due to the introduction of special \u2018beach wheelchairs\u2019 which are available free of charge at North Bull Island and Dollymount Strand. For visitors, another popular way to explore the biosphere is on the award-winning Biosphere Discovery Tour which is run by Dublin Bay Cruises. Furthermore, 1600 Dublin bikes and explore the Biosphere on Dublin\u2019s newest Coastal Mobility Route, which comprises over 3.6km of cycling and walking path along Dublin\u2019s coastline which was opened in 2020. Since opening, the Coastal Mobility Route has become an important sustainable transport corridor for Dublin which helps to spread our visitors more sustainably throughout the city. The route is also fitted with smart sensors to measure its usage. Its success has transformed how people get around Dublin, with over 20,000 cycle trips being recorded every week, a 100% increase since 2019.Find out more at: &lt;a href=\"https://www.dublinbaybiosphere.ie\"&gt;https://www.dublinbaybiosphere.ie&lt;/a&gt;</p>",

For drivers to be able to see which parking space is free at any time, and therefore plan where they could park, a special application for mobile devices has been created and is available to everyone, both the citizens of Dubrovnik and tourists. This saves drivers time looking for a free parking space and reduces congestion caused in large part by drivers circling the streets in search of an available space to park. In some places in the city, a system of twenty public information displays has been set up to enable those citizens who do not use the application to see the free parking spaces a few streets earlier and to be able to see which place is available in time.

This project began in 2017 and provided some momentum for culture and creativity in the city, not only in terms of activities and cultural expression, but also in terms of creation and redevelopment of cultural spaces and hubs, plus promotion of gatherings to share experiences. The City of Media Arts has essentially operated out of two \u201chouses\u201d - gnration and the Theatro Circo - and has also helped to revitalise these spaces. The cultural centre gnration is a space for creation, performance, and exhibition in the field of contemporary music and the relationship between art and technology. By adopting a sustained strategy, always open to the community, it intends to confirm its status as a unifying pole for cultural and creative dynamics, making it a space oriented towards educating and raising awareness in a new audience, demonstrating artistic practices relevant from a contemporary and cosmopolitan perspective. The cultural schedule of gnration is founded on two fundamental pillars, which can be viewed independently or jointly. Contemporary music and the relationship between art and technology are central to the programme, whether the profile is performance, exhibition, or education. Also operating inside this space is Startup Braga, a corporate incubator which seeks to foster and encourage entrepreneurship in the city and has the municipality\u2019s support. Today, the Theatro Circo is a really dynamic cultural broadcasting centre, time and again exceeding the target of 100,000 spectators to become a geographical hub.

It introduces visitors to the social and historical atmosphere of the 18th century Dubrovnik Republic. Considering that the Dubrovnik Museums own a rare historical instrument-fortepiano built by Viennese builder Anton Walter in 1790, the project contains specialised costumed performance on period instruments with storytelling.The aim of this project is not just to present and highlight the values and richness of both tangible and non-tangible cultural heritage, but to also immerse visitors into the special historical environment of a reconstructed event in the Rector\u2019s Palace. Therefore, Concert by the Rector\u2019s which is implemented as an additional cultural- touristic programme of Dubrovnik Museums offers live performances in the presence of the Rector himself who is the host to the event. Performed both in Croatian and English, it brings the story of the life of composers whose works are performed as well as the history of the Dubrovnik noble families and their relations to European cultural centres of the time. Listening to the music performed on the original period instrument, accompanied by the degustation of the preferred sweet of the Dubrovnik nobility, the visitors are becoming a part of an exclusive cultural event which connects musical performance with its socio-cultural context.

Here stories and research met the perspective of architects, conservators, social historians, former residents, artists, and archivists. Additionally, in Spring 2021, 14 Henrietta Street was invited to participate in a European pilot project alongside museums such as Pompidou and Courtauld to use their software and data loggers. These provided feedback support and support for the ongoing development of software in building conservation to reduce day to day environmental damage, preserve objects and protect the fabric of the building. Visitors receive a guided experience through the house with the stories told through our guides, poetry, digital archive films and stories. The building is the primary artefact in the collection, and first-hand memories and handed down stories from former residents and their families inform the tour and animate the building\u2019s curation.

It also represents another success in terms of \u201cbalance\u201d; the emergence of this new tourist district has contributed to spreading the flux of visitors over the city. For instance, Les Bassins de Lumi\u00e8res, the largest digital art centre in France, is housed in an old submarine base from the Second World War, plunging visitors into the works of Monet, Renoir, and Chagall. Similarly, Le Mus\u00e9e Mer Marine is another symbolic building to have emerged in the district, shining a light on the oceanic world and sailing, and the Cap Sciences popularises scientific culture for both adults and children. These cultural establishments live alongside open-air bars, restaurant boats, an indoor-market, venues for music and dance shows, plus nightlife hotspots that attract locals and visitors alike.

The Old Vine virtual experience is an upgrade of the remarkable story of the 450-year-old vine. The VR headset transforms visitors into the Old Vine and takes them through time from 1570 to the present day. During this VR experience, visitors can also get to know important Maribor historical events, personalities and legends and observe the changes that took place on Lent over the centuries. The Old Vine House is located in the heart of the old city centre. The age of the \u201c\u017dametovka\u201d or \u201cModra Kav\u010dina\u201d vine is over 400 years and has won it a place in the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest noble grapevine in the world still bearing grapes. The Old Vine is a symbol of the rich wine culture of Maribor, Styria, and all of Slovenia. The house was built in the 16th century, and the south side of the House has seen no major architectural changes since then. Today, the Old Vine House is a temple of wine tradition and culture of Maribor, Styria, and Slovenia, offering guided tours of rich wine legacy and other museum exhibits.

In order to break with this traditional policy of concealment that most museums around the world must adhere to due to space or other factors, the museum is making the compete collection visible to the public. By opening the first publicly accessible museum deport in the world, Rotterdam is ensuring that visitors will get an unobstructed behind the scenes view of the rest of the collection along with what goes into its preservation and maintenance of the artefacts and artworks on display.
