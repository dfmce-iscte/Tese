With the Acoustic Pedestrian Warning Device, when the pedestrian signal transmitters change colour, audible messages are given to the pedestrians, allowing them to cross the street or wait.\u202fWhen the pedestrians come to the pedestrian crossing, when they show their hand from 5cm distance or touch, the system sends a request for a pedestrian crossing to the intersection device. When the time given for crossing the road is completed, the beep sound indicated for the red light will be activated and this warning will continue until the request button is pressed again. In addition, warnings in touristic areas are made in English.\u202f  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out more at: https://raillynews.com/2020/12/Traffic-lights-will-speak-for-the-visually-impaired-in-Antalya/</p>"

Besides raising awareness for a better education and better future, the overall objective is to provide equal opportunities to individuals with autism and their families who cannot be included in these programs due to financial difficulties. Individuals with autism can benefit from education and rehabilitation services for free, develop their creativity and socialize by performing artistic activities. The Autism Life Center has a floor area of 210 m and can serve 400 individuals and its training and development programs are tailored to different age groups and individual skills.

The JAM card can be presented discretely in a public environment to tell people that the holder may need a bit more time or additional assistance. Team members across the Trigon Group\u2019s hotels have been trained to identify and support customers and fellow team members carrying JAM Cards. The Trigon Hotel Group has further shown its commitment to accessibility by raising \u20ac11,000 to fund the creation of a new wheelchair-accessible sensory garden in the city, offering young people and adults with learning disabilities an \u201coasis of calm\u201d in the busy city.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;21 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out more at: https://www.jamcard.org</p>"

This flexibility benefits people with \"temporary disabilities\" and those whose abilities change as they age. In overall, accessibility will make the environment easier to use for people with walking sticks/crutches, elderly people, mothers pushing pushchairs, but also people carrying their luggage, or almost all people after an accident.

Szeged is in a fortunate position: As its territory is rich in &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;30 renewable energy sources, it will support the city in achieving its sustainability goals. The number of annual hours of sunshine and the radiation intensity make Szeged the most favourable region in Hungary in terms of solar energy. The geothermal potential of the region is excellent, too: A significant amount of geothermal heat can be extracted and can play a major role in the district heating supply of the city. Biomass and wind energy are also economically viable sources of renewable energy that could help the city to expand its renewable energy potential.  &lt;br&gt;Find out more at : https://energiaklub.hu/en/project/sustainable-energy-and-climate-action-plan-for-szeged-city-4660&lt;br&gt;</p>"

The Municipality has started the construction of a hotel with modern-looking tiny caravans in the recreation area and set the target to complete the project and put it into service very soon. Within the scope of the hotel project, for the protection and continuity of natural resources, water will be drained after each individual gets into the water.

Additionally, the construction of extensive green roofs on the roofs of 30 prefabricated buildings has been foreseen (about 150 staircases). This could prove to be very effective: it would reduce the energy consumption of the building for heating and cooling purposes and create a more pleasant indoor climate.

The intervention aims to: Enhance and increase the supply of green areas; Mitigate the impact of pollutants in the various districts of the city and in those most exposed; Create a network of green areas equipped for the system of sports facilities for the XX Mediterranean Games. The function of the Green Belt is also linked to the enhancement of the scenic beauty of the Taranto area, the use of the coast in terms of sustainable tourism and the creation of territorial facilities related to holding events and large outdoor events Green Belt will constitute a real \"connective ecological infrastructure\", not only physical but also social. The project was launched at the end of 2021 with the planting of the first 6,000 trees which, on average, can absorb about 90 tons of carbon dioxide per year. Once the project is completed, the Green Belt will be able to absorb an average of 15,000 tons of CO2 per year.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;36 &lt;br&gt;Find out more at:https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7800&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>"

These lanes and Greenways give locals and visitors a real alternative to driving and are complemented by a map of Cork\u2019s best cycling routes.

The plan will help Szeged to synthesize existing urban and transport development plans and aims to provide sustainable &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;43 and integrated solutions to urban transport problems. This will eventually contribute to climate protection and energy efficiency objectives. Through the Sustainable Mobility Plan, the development of cycling will be prioritized in the city and the municipality has already taken several positive measures for cycling paths. The aim is to further increase the proportion of road sections with 40% of cycling facilities, and the public bicycle system will be operational from 2013. As a result, the share of cycling has doubled in the last decade and is expected to continue to grow until 2030. The SUMP also aims to improve conditions for pedestrian transport, to decongest the inner city, to create an intermodal hub between bus and rail, to develop complex transport in neighborhoods, to use intelligent transport systems and to influence the choices of road users. &lt;br&gt;Find out more at :  https://sump-central.eu/2020/11/07/sustainable-urban-mobility-plan-of-szeged/  https://www.eltis.org/it/node/49075  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>"

By using AR (augmented reality), a technology that generates a three-dimensional virtual image, the app can show a virtual map that guides users to the places where mentioned buildings used to be located. In those particular locations, there are boards with a special tracker (geometric symbol) which users have to scan to see the virtual image. Thus, a virtually recreated building appears on the empty squares. Both objects can be observed at scale or real size and rotated around their axis.

SASMob is based on two interconnected pillars: Employers\u2019 mobility pledges coupled with a data driven intelligent transport system. The SASMob project aims to tackle congestion, poor air quality and noise exposure by building a data-driven intelligent transport system based on a structured multi-governance model with both public and private companies and transport providers. The mobility pledges have adapted a successful practice by creating cooperation agreements between the urban authority and local employers in order to change institutional working arrangements and influence individual behaviour. The used sensor is unique in Europe: It analyses camera images of passing vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians and it analyses WiFi signals from smart phones. Connecting these two types of data helps to provide a full picture of mobility in the city. Besides SASMob, the city and its partners are participating in different mobility related research and action projects including Low-Carb and SUMI.  &lt;br&gt;Find out more at: http://sasmob-szeged.eu/en/   https://uia-initiative.eu/en/uia-cities/szeged</p>"

The designation of several new \u2018Cultural City Quarters\u2019 has brought together the hospitality, retail and tourism sectors in these quarters and injected a renewed enthusiasm for collaborative initiatives that showcase the individual identity and unique attributes of each neighbourhood. Cork is also an active participant in the national \u2018Culture Night\u2019 celebrations, running since2006, during which arts and cultural organisations and venues across Ireland extend their opening hours in order to encourage and inspire public engagement, by running workshops, exhibitions and events free of charge. The festival has grown year-on-year, and despite the challenges of Covid restrictions in 2021, approximately 100 events took place in Cork for Culture Night, which is testament to the creativity and dedication of the Arts sector in the City.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;71 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out more at:  https://www.corkcity.ie/en/council-services/services/arts-culture-heritage/heritage/cultural-heritage1.html</p>"
